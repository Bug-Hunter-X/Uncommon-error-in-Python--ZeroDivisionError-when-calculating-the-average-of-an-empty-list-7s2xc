This repository contains a Python function that calculates the average of a list of numbers. The function includes error handling for an empty list to prevent a ZeroDivisionError. The solution shows improved error handling for non-numeric input. This demonstrates an uncommon error in Python, where an empty list results in a ZeroDivisionError. The solution also shows how to check the input to avoid this error.
